[Simplify3D](www.simplify3d.com) Settings for the [RepRap Wilson II](https://www.tindie.com/products/mjrice/reprap-wilson-ii-complete-3d-printer-kit-/) 3D Printer

I have had some excellent results lately with my Wilson II printer using Simplify3D's excellent slicing software. With the settings in this project, I have been to reliably, and relatively quickly, print some rather complex objects. Hopefully you find these settings useful as well.

Just to give you an idea of the print quality, below are some pictures of a float bracket I designed and printed. It is 5mm thick, well-printed, and quite sturdy:
